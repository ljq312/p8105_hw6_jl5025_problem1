In this homework, we use “NYC restaurant inspection” dataset. There are total 397584 obs. of 18 variables. After cleaning the data, we selected 4 variables -- boro, grade, cuisine_description, and violation_description to analysze.

### Problem 1

\
We made 3 plots to visualize our analysis:

* **The 10 most frequently used words in violation description chart:** There is a violation description for each restaurant, and we are curious about what words are most frequently used to describe these restaurants. We un-nest the description so that each word is contained within a separate row, remove stopwords and then count the frequency of each word. We chose 10 most frequently used words. The words' frequency is also shown in our graph.  It is very funny to get “flies” in the result and it seems that people are not satisfied about the restaurant in NYC. 

* **The percentage of “A”, “B”, “C” restaurants in NYC chart: ** We calculated the percentage of restaurant numbers at grade A, B, and C using *group_by, summarize,* and* mutate* to make a donut chart. Overall, New Yorkers give most of the restaurants “A”.

* **The number of “A”, “B”, “C” restaurants for each boro chart:** We made a bar chart showing the numbers of restaurant with different grade in each boro of NYC, analyzing data using *group_by, summarize,* and then *spread* the data horizontally by their grades.

### Problem 2

To increase the interaction, we created a shiny enabled dashboard based on the three charts we made in Problem 1. We set two widget types:

* *slider inputs* for 85 different cuisine types

* *radio buttons* for 5 distinct boros in NYC

With these two widgets, people can choose a specific cuisine or a particular boro they interested in to view the charts.
